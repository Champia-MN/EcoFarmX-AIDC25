#  EcoFarmX – Smart Farming for a Greener Future

##  Project Summary
EcoFarmX is a real-time smart farming system that monitors temperature, humidity, and soil moisture using IoT sensors. It empowers farmers to make eco-friendly decisions that improve crop yield, reduce water waste, and promote sustainable agriculture practices.

---

##  Problem Statement
Farmers, especially in rural areas, lack access to real-time soil and climate data, leading to over-irrigation, under-watering, and poor crop health. This results in environmental damage and reduced productivity.

---

##  Our Solution
EcoFarmX uses low-cost IoT sensors (ESP32, soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors) to collect live field data. The data is visualized on a user-friendly mobile app (built using FlutterFlow) to help farmers make quick, informed decisions.
